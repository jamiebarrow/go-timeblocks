# go-timeblocks

This repo has two purposes:

1. Creating an application to manage timeblocks within a day
2. Learning Go

I intend to build an app using Go to try and learn the language.
I have had an idea to create a time tracking application for a long time.
The design I had initially was for a GUI based tool, whether a web application or desktop application.
This repo will likely start out just as a command line application, and perhaps grow into that.

I will be building this in public, and likely will make a lot of mistakes (whether intentionally or not) as part of my learning.
